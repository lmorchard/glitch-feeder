Glitch Feeder
=============

Someday, this wants to grow up to be a simple remixable feed reader.

## TODO

- Start / pause / stop feed polls from the web UI with queue monitoring via websocket
- Loading indicators for folders, feeds overall, appending feeds, appending items
- Hide "More Feeds" button when no feeds are left to load
- Counts for items in folders, feeds, remaining for more feeds
- Reader state in URL to bookmark / refresh at last folder & item view
- Remote feed subscription bookmarklet
- Implement a proper FeedFolder model with sub-folders
- OPML live playlist subscription
- Variable maxage per feed with AIMD adjustment based on when new items are found
- Read / unread flags
